Today I plan on starting the development of the project. I've looked over the instructions and formulated a brief dev plan. I plan on implementing the logger first and once it is working move on to the encrypter.

I've mannaged to start the development of the logger. Right now it only writes [timestamp] [input] to the file specified in the program arguments. I still have a lot to modify but it was a good start.

Today I plan on finishing up the logger and then start on the encrypter.

After some work I managed to finish and polish the logger, and started on the encrypter. Right now the encryter works, but there are still some small changes I want (and kinda need) to make.

Today I plan on finishing the encrypter and making some polishing changes.

I've polished the encrypter and tested it with a few messages. It works as intended, so next thing to do is implement the driver.

[03/16]
Today I plan on starting (and hopefully finishing) the development of the driver.

[03/16]
After some small tweaks to the logger, the driver is now implemented and working as intended. I may have to make a few small changes, but overall I'm happy with the progress.

Today I plan on polishing the driver.

[03/17]
After more than a few small changes, the driver is NOW fully working as intended. Let's go

I've finished the project and added a readme for convenience.
